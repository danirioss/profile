          <h2>Who Am I</h2>
          <p>Despite my age - 36 yo - I'm a junior full-stack develper, originally from Brazil, currently leaving in Byron Bay, Australia. looking forward my 1st aopportunity in this area. I've finished a bootcamp at Le Wagon São Paulo in Dec 2022 and there I realize that code is my new thing. I've always had a passion for studying and learning - I'm graduated in Biology and Journalism - so when I came across with this endless, challenging and so interesting new subject I decided that this was going to be my new career.

          My current tech stack is Ruby on Rails but I'm very open to figure out new technologies.

          When I'm not coding, I like to travel, practice yoga, drink wine, but the truth is that most part of the time I'm looking after my little baby Odin, who is 9 months old. And I can assure you, learn how to code and breastfeed at the same time is quite a big challenge - but I did it!
